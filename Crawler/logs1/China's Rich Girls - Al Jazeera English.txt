China's Rich Girls - Al Jazeera English
We enter the inner circle of China’s new generation of elites to get an insight into a world where money is no object.
Flashy, materialistic, with more money than they can spend - these are the privileged children of China's top 1 percent.
From crashing sports cars to setting bank notes alight, their antics are notorious.
As they splurge on multimillion-dollar properties, luxury yachts and endless shopping sprees in cities such as Vancouver, Canada, one group of girls is playing out their exploits on a reality TV show.
101 East is invited into the girls' inner circle and finds out what goes on in a world where money is no object.
